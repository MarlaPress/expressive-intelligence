# Expressive Intelligence™ in the Age of AI: How to Avoid Template Voice

You can hear Template Voice everywhere now.

Keynotes that sound like they were assembled from LinkedIn posts.  
Websites that seem impressive but say nothing.  
Scripts that look perfect on the page and die the second they are spoken out loud.

Most of this is not written by AI alone. It is written by smart people who have uploaded their stories, their offers, their bio, then fallen into the Perfect Prompt Trap. They hand all that good raw material to the tool, then give it a generic or “perfect” prompt and hope it will magically evolve their content for them.

The missing skill is not better prompts. It is Expressive Intelligence.

The real shift is this. AI works best as a conversation, not a command. Expressive Intelligence is what you bring to that conversation before you type a single prompt. When you bring your style, quirks, fears, conviction, and your actual point of view into that back and forth, and you stay with it until it feels true in your body, that is when you create more interesting, powerful, aligned content.

## The Perfect Prompt Trap

The Perfect Prompt Trap sounds like this:

“Just give me the magic prompt that will make the AI sound exactly like me.”

Here is the problem.

If you do not know your real voice before you open the tool, all a perfect prompt can do is generate a perfectly polished stranger.

You can paste your about page, your blog posts, your podcast transcripts, your talk outline. You can upload all the data you want.

If the underlying voice is vague, careful, or approval driven, the model will happily scale that. You will get more content, not more truth.

AI does not erase your voice. It multiplies whatever you feed it.

Give it a template self, you get Template Voice.  
Give it a clear, grounded, expressive self, and it can help you structure and amplify that.

The missing piece is upstream. It is you.

## Template Voice versus true voice

Template Voice has a very specific sound.

It uses phrases everyone else uses.  
It tells stories you could swap between industries.  
It hits all the correct beats and leaves no fingerprints.

Template Voice:

- Explains, but does not risk.  
- Flows, but does not cut.  
- Sounds smart, but feels empty.

True voice is different.

It might be cleaner or rougher, but you can feel a human behind it. A specific human. Someone with an actual stake in what they are saying.

True voice:

- Has a line it will not cross out, even if it feels risky.  
- Has a way of describing things that sounds like a real conversation, not a brochure.  
- Has opinions that are not crowd approved.

AI can help you land either one.  
Expressive Intelligence decides which one you are feeding it.

## Content versus conviction

This is the part most people skip.

AI is excellent at content.

Content is structure, headlines, transitions, examples, formatting. It is the “how” of the message.

Conviction is different.

Conviction is the stake.  
Conviction is the nerve.  
Conviction is the emotional weight behind the words.

Conviction says:

“This is what I believe. This is what it costs you. This is what I am willing to stand behind in public.”

AI can write a paragraph about anything. It cannot decide what you are willing to stand behind.

So if you open your tool and start with “Write me a talk about leadership for a corporate audience,” you have handed away the most important decision.

The model will give you content. Nicely structured. Smoothly written. Template Voice.

But if you start with conviction, everything changes.

For example:

“I believe that trying to be liked makes leaders weaker, not stronger. I work with directors and VPs who are exhausted from trying to please everyone. My style is direct, warm, and a little playful. I do not want buzzwords or motivational fluff. Help me structure a talk around that.”

Now you are not asking the model to find your voice. You are asking it to support your voice.

That is Expressive Intelligence.

## Where speakers and business owners get into trouble

This shows up everywhere right now.

- The speaker who feeds their story into AI, asks for “a TED style keynote,” and ends up with something they cannot say without sounding like a parody of themselves.  
- The business owner who uploads all their offers and then asks the model to “write a high converting homepage,” and ends up with a site that could belong to anyone in their industry.  
- The creator who pastes ten posts, asks for “twenty more in my voice,” and ends up with twenty perfectly forgettable posts.

In each case, the person did the “right” thing technically. They fed data. They used prompts. They edited a little.

What they did not do was lead.

They did not specify what they actually believe.  
They did not name what they refuse to sound like.  
They did not protect the uncomfortable sentence that carries their edge.

The tool did its job. It tried to please everyone.  
Which is exactly what kills presence on stage and online.

## Expressive Intelligence as the upstream advantage

Expressive Intelligence is your ability to express your inner world clearly, honestly, and with enough presence that it lands.

In the Age of AI, E-IQ becomes an upstream advantage.

It lets you:

- Notice when the draft sounds smooth but emotionally flat.  
- Feel the difference between “my voice” and “a professional voice.”  
- Decide which parts of a script or article must stay human, even if the tool suggests something neater.

People worry that AI will erase their uniqueness. The truth is harsher and simpler.

If you do not exercise your E-IQ, you will erase your own uniqueness, then give the model the job of copying what is left.

## A simple E-IQ workflow for using AI without losing yourself

Here is a practical way to work with AI so you avoid Template Voice and keep your presence.

### Step 1: Clarify your stake and style before you open the tool

Two short questions, answered in plain language:

- What is the one thing I am willing to stand behind in this talk, post, or page.  
- How do I naturally speak when I am with someone I trust.

Write the answers as if you were texting a friend. No performance. No “brand voice.” Just you.

This is your Expressive Intelligence handshake.

### Step 2: Start a conversation, not a command

Instead of:

“Write a keynote about imposter syndrome for entrepreneurs.”

Try:

“I help entrepreneurs who secretly feel like imposters. My style is clear, direct, and conversational. I do not want a motivational speech. I want something that names the fear and gives them a grounded way to move through it. Ask me five questions so you can understand my point of view and voice before we outline the talk.”

Now the model is not guessing who you are. You are telling it.  
And you have invited it into a back and forth.

You can answer its questions honestly:

- What you have lived.  
- What you have seen.  
- What you refuse to say, even if it would sell more tickets.

That is Expressive Intelligence in motion.

### Step 3: Use AI for content, then re insert your conviction

Once you have an outline or draft, let AI help with structure.

Ask it to:

- Tighten long sections.  
- Suggest clearer transitions.  
- Offer alternative hooks or headlines.

Then read it out loud.

Anything you trip over, or feel fake saying, is not your voice.  
Anything that feels smooth but dull is Template Voice trying to sneak in.

Mark those lines. Rewrite them in your own words.  
Add back one sentence that feels a little uncomfortable because it is so honest.

That is usually the sentence your audience needs most.

### Step 4: Protect one sharp sentence

Make a rule.

Every talk, every script, every article gets one sentence that is undeniably you.

Maybe it is a strong opinion.  
Maybe it is a vivid analogy.  
Maybe it is a simple line of truth that cuts through the noise.

You can let AI support it, but you do not let it sand it down.

This one sentence often becomes the line people quote back to you.  
That is your Expressive Intelligence leaving a fingerprint.

## Expressive Intelligence in the Age of AI

AI will keep getting better at predicting what an average expert might say.

Which means sounding like an average expert will be easier than ever, and less valuable than ever.

Expressive Intelligence is what keeps you from drifting into that average.

It reminds you:

- Your job is not to sound impressive. Your job is to sound true.  
- The machine can help with efficiency. Only you can bring honesty.  
- Your discomfort around a sentence is often a clue that it matters, not a sign to delete it.

AI is not the end of human voice. It is the stress test.

If you can still sound like yourself with all of this power at your fingertips, that is a sign your voice is grounded, not accidental.

And that voice is the one your audience will follow.
