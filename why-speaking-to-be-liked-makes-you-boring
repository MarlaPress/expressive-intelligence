# Why Speaking to Be Liked Makes You Boring

## The Like Trap

You were taught to be liked.  
By teachers, bosses, algorithms, parents.  

If you speak on stage, post on social media, or write to be heard, this applies to you.

Because the need to be liked doesn’t make you relatable. It makes you forgettable.

The Like Trap doesn’t just dilute your energy, it erases your message.  
This isn’t about being rude. It’s about being real enough to move the room, even if it splits them.

I know the feeling. When I first started speaking publicly, I wanted so desperately to appear competent, and ultimately liked, that I took on a whole different expert persona.

She was stiff. Aloof. Polished to the point of detachment.  
I thought I was projecting confidence.  
What I was really doing was disconnecting.

Later, I found myself editing social posts to sound “smart enough.”  
Cutting what I actually thought because someone might disagree.  
Holding back pieces of myself just to stay inoffensive.

I wasn’t being strategic.  
I was being small.

The Like Trap starts early. Be polite. Don’t upset anyone. Fit in.  
These are survival instructions for school, family, and corporate life. You learn to round your edges, smile through discomfort, and blend just enough to avoid rejection.

Then it evolves.

Now your likes, views, and comments are metrics. On social media, the Like Trap doesn’t just train your behavior, it conditions your voice. You say what’s agreeable. You edit out the edges. You ask performative questions instead of offering real answers.

You become a brand instead of a person.  
What you post is palatable. What you say is polished.  
And what people feel is nothing.

The Like Trap rewards you just enough to keep you stuck in neutral.

## The Cost of Playing It Safe

Let’s run a thought experiment. One I first heard from a mentor:

**Scenario A**: 80% of the audience liked your talk. 20% were indifferent. No one was upset.  
**Scenario B**: 30% loved your talk. 50% liked it. 20% hated it.

Most speakers, especially newer ones, pick A.  
It feels better. No pushback. No rejection. A clean scorecard.

But Scenario A is a graveyard.  
No friction. No spark. No story worth retelling.  
It’s a standing ovation you don’t survive.

Scenario B? That’s movement. That’s power. That’s presence.

When you’re fully expressive and unfiltered enough to stand for something, you will provoke. You will challenge. And yes, some people may resist it in real time.

But some of those “no thanks” people?  
They come back months later. They refer you. They quote you.  
You didn’t please them. You *moved* them.

People don’t share what they merely like.  
They share what shakes them. Challenges them. Makes them feel seen or called out.

## How the Like Trap Shrinks You

The Like Trap shows up in how you speak but also how you post, pitch, and publish.

You shrink your energy.  
You second-guess your tone.  
You avoid saying what you believe because someone might not agree.  
You diffuse instead of direct. You soften instead of stake. You lower your volume, not the sound, but the voltage.

You think you’re being careful.  
What you’re really being is small.

Presence expands when you stop editing to please people who were never going to buy in anyway.

This isn’t about being brash. It’s about being uncaged.  
Speaking from your whole self instead of the piece you think they’ll clap for.

## Closing the Trap

The opposite of the Like Trap isn’t hostility. It’s honesty.

It’s expressing your message with enough presence that people either lean in or lean away.

It’s trusting that those who are ready will find you. And those who aren’t will walk, freeing up space for the ones who are.

When you speak to be liked, you disappear.  
When you speak from full presence, you don’t just get attention. You create resonance.

This is where **Expressive Intelligence™** begins, not with polish, but with permission.  
To stop shrinking. To take up space. To be clear enough to love or hate, but never ignore.

E-IQ gives you the awareness and tools to express your full presence, without apology.  
To hold your power, not perform for it.  

You don’t need everyone to like it.  
You need the right people to feel it.
